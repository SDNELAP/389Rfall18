*I would approach this problem by telling my boss. If my boss ignores these prevalent problems, I would anonymously report my findings to a consumer watchdog who can then lobby for a response on behalf of the company and consumers. It may be unsafe to release the information to the public as there are people in the public who can exploit these security flaws once they are informed of their existence which can danger the lives of occupants. It is my opinion that I am responsible for the harm that results from silence as I have the voice and duty to speak up about security issues in the ECU's firmware as a junior developer whose job is to audit said issues. Therefore, one way or another, I must report those flaws but the first report would undoubtedly go to my boss. If he ignores these issues, I have two options. The first is to accept and respect his decision and remain subordinate or I can leak these details to a consumer watchdog who can pressure the company into taking action. As previously stated, I would do the latter as my boss would be neglecting his duties which endanger lives of consumers and very knowledge of that fact makes me accountable for the lack of action. Hence, I would take action and leak not only the security issues in the firmware but I would also report the boss's inaction to the consumer watchdog so that he can answer for his wrongful neglect of a serious issue.*
